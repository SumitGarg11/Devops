DevOps is a modern approach that integrates development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to
improve collaboration, efficiency, and delivery speed in software development and deployment.
It builds upon and addresses some of the limitations of traditional SDLC models like Waterfall, Agile, and Lean.

Why DevOps is Better than Traditional SDLC Models

1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Keywords: Automation, Frequent Releases, Rapid Feedback, Quality Assurance
DevOps Approach: With DevOps, you implement CI/CD pipelines. This means that code changes are automatically tested and deployed frequently.
For Facebook, this allows developers to release new features or bug fixes quickly and efficiently, providing users with timely updates and improvements.

2. . Collaboration and Communication Keywords: Cross-Functional Teams, Shared Responsibilities, Continuous Feedback

Scenario: In a traditional Agile setup, development and operations teams might still work in silos, even if they collaborate during sprints.
This can lead to miscommunications and delays in resolving issues.

DevOps Approach: DevOps fosters a collaborative culture where developers, operations, and other stakeholders work together as a unified team.
For Facebook, this means that developers who write the code also collaborate closely with operations to ensure smooth deployment and performance monitoring.

3 . Automation and Efficiency Keywords: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Automated Testing, Deployment Pipelines

Scenario: In a traditional Lean model, efficiency improvements are often manual and incremental.
This might involve optimizing processes or workflows but can still be slow to implement.
